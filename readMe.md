# 📝 Git Commit Message Guide

A clear and consistent commit message style improves project readability, history tracking, and collaboration.  
This guide follows **Conventional Commits** best practices.

---

## ✅ Principles

- **Imperative mood** → “Add feature” not “Added feature”  
- **Concise subject** → ≤ 50 characters  
- **Wrap body text** → at 72 characters  
- **Explain what & why** → not just *how*  
- **Blank line** between subject and body

## 🎯 Commit Types

- **feat:** new feature  
- **fix:** bug fix  
- **docs:** documentation only  
- **style:** formatting, whitespace, no logic change  
- **refactor:** code restructuring without behavior change  
- **perf:** performance improvements  
- **test:** adding or updating tests  
- **chore:** maintenance tasks (configs, CI/CD, dependencies)

## 🏆 Best Practices

- Capitalize subject line  
- No period at the end of subject line  
- Use bullet points in body for multiple changes  
- Reference issues (`Closes #123`, `Refs #456`)  
- Keep commits focused and atomic  
- Small changes (typo/format) → one-liner is fine
